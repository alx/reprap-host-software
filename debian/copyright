from Ed Sells, Simon McAuliffe, Vik Olliver, Zach Smith, and Jonathan
Marsden.

This package was built by Jonathan Marsden <jmarsden@fastmail.fm> .
Current sources are found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/reprap/

The only changes made are the addition of the Debian package maintenance 
system.
