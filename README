reprap-host-20070603

This is a very early attempt at a quick package of the Reprap host
software.  It should run on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh.

DOCUMENTATION:

See http://www.reprap.org for project details.

See http://www.reprap.org/bin/view/Main/DriverSoftware for the closest
thing we have to a user namual for this host software at this stage.

Please use http://forums.reprap.org to ask about this package.

NOTES:

(1) You need a working Java 1.5.0 or later JRE to run this.
(2) You need to manually install the Java3D libraries.
(3) You need to manually install the rxtx libraries ( http://www.rxtx.org )

KNOWN BUGS:

(1) This software uses way too much memory and so cannot build complex
    objects, including some of the Reprap parts.

(2) Probably many other bugs, less serious than (1) above!  See
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=159590 for more.
